AIR POLLUTION INDEX

This project is quite simple. It measures the concentration of different gases, humidity and temperature in the atmosphere. It uses basic MQ sensors and dust sensor and a temperature and humidity sensor which are collaborated using a node MCU(Arduino board with esp 8266) which sends the measured data to the online database which is further displayed on a webpage(code included), which is refreshed every 30 seconds. Sensors were collaborated using the graphs of the sensors, so it is almost accurate too.
